# Assisted Review Portal

## Overview

The Assisted Review Portal (ARP) is a web application that stores screenshots and associated incidents in a structured manner. It has been developed to conduct linguistic reviews using screenshots of the product's user interface. It enables users to see the translated strings in context to provide accurate translations. ARP also has an image comparison feature to identify any changes that have occurred between different versions of the product, which can reduce the manual effort in regression testing.
